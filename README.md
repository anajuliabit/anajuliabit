# Hi! 👋 I'm Ana.

Over the course of my four-year journey, I have had the privilege of working alongside some exceptional minds, an experience that has contributed significantly to my professional and personal growth. In 2021, I shifted my career focus from backend engineering to smart contract engineering. My conviction that decentralized systems are the future has been the driving force behind my decision to make this transition.
