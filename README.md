# Hi! 👋 I'm Ana.

As a self-taught person, I have developed a deep interest in immersing myself in various subjects through perusing literature, examining documentation, and engaging in side projects. Throughout my four-year journey, I have had the privilege of collaborating with exceptional experts, which has significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth. In 2021, I shifted my career focus from backend engineering to smart contract engineering due to my belief that decentralized systems are the future.
