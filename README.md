# Hi! 👋 I'm Ana.

As a self-taught person, I have explored diverse learning paths, like delving into literature, studying documentation, creating personal projects, and taking on algorithmic challenges. Throughout my four-year journey as a developer, I have had the privilege of collaborating with exceptional minds, whose influence has positively impacted both my personal and professional growth. In 2021, I shift my focus from backend engineering to smart contract engineering, motivated by my conviction that decentralization has the potential to create a more equitable world.
