\begin{cvparagraph}
  I have been working as a software engineer for the past five years. Initially, I started my career as a full-stack developer and became an expert in Typescript. However, I soon realized the need for specialization, which led me to spend two years mastering backend development. My interest in blockchain technology peaked in 2021, and I decided to transition into a full-time role as a blockchain engineer. This year, I have focused on improving my expertise in identifying vulnerabilities in Solidity contracts, as I am particularly interested in security research. I believe that meticulous organization is crucial to success, which is why my approach to work and life is highly systematic.
