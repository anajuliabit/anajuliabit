I have been working in software engineering for five years, starting as a full-stack developer and honing my skills in various technologies. However, I realized that specialization was necessary, which led me to spend two years mastering backend development. My passion for blockchain technology peaked in 2021, motivating me to transition into a full-time role as a blockchain engineer. This year, I have focused on improving my expertise in identifying vulnerabilities within Solidity contracts, as I am particularly interested in security research.

As a Unix user, I am always searching for ways to optimize my operating system and achieve the best performance possible. I rely heavily on Emacs, which is versatile and streamlines my development workflow. My approach to work and life is highly systematic because I believe meticulous organization is crucial to success.\end{cvparagraph}
